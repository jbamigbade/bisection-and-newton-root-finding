# Bisection and Newton Root-Finding ‚Äì MATG 5410 Homework 5

This repository contains Octave code for solving nonlinear equations using two classical numerical algorithms: **Bisection Method** and **Newton's Method**. It was submitted as part of Homework 5 for the MATG 5410: Numerical Methods course.

## üìå Objectives

- Implement the **Bisection Method**: `bisection(f, a, b, nmax, epsi)`
- Implement **Newton‚Äôs Method**: `newton(f, df, x, nmax, epsi, delta)`
- Apply these methods to a series of functions and save the computed roots
- Output results in a clearly structured `.txt` file
